# reel-rendezview

## Project Description
The ReelRendezView site allows the user to find movies based on the year they were born and then view the trailer for the movie they select. First, the user will enter their birth year into a form. From there, a list of popular movies that were released in that year will be displayed on the page. This will be done by making a call to the TMDB API. Each movie that appears will contain a link that takes the user to the movie trailer for the selected movie on YouTube. This will happen by making a call to the YouTube Data API that returns the five movie trailers specified in the list. This site contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that each work together to form this functioning site. This will allow the user a fun and different way to discover new movies rather than scrolling through streaming platforms or the internet. 

## User Story
As a movie enthusiast, I want to search movies that were released the year I was born, so that I can discover new movies to watch in a fun way.

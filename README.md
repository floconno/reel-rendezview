# reel-rendezview

## Project Description
The ReelRendezView site allows the user to find movies based on the year they were born and then view the trailer for the movie they select. First, the user will enter their birth year into a form. From there, a list of 5 movies that were released in that year will be displayed on the page. This will be done by making a call to the TMDB API. Each movie that appears will contain a link that takes the user to the movie trailer for the selected movie on YouTube. This will happen by making a call to the YouTube Data API that returns the five movie trailers specified in the list. This site contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that each work together to form this functioning site. This will allow the user a fun and different way to discover new movies rather than scrolling through streaming platforms or the internet. 

## User Story
As a user, I want to enter my birth year into the site that will then display different movies and links to their trailers so that I can discover new movies to watch in a new and different way.

## Rough Task Break Down
Two people will work on the JavaScript
One person will work on the HTML
One person will work on the CSS
All four members of the group will contribute to the files and help one another during the process.
This is a rough breakdown and will likely change when we have a more detailed outline of what we need to include in our code.
